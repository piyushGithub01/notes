NoSQL Database Types
Document databases pair each key with a complex data structure known as a document. Documents can contain many different key-value pairs, or 
key-array pairs, or even nested documents.

Graph stores are used to store information about networks of data, such as social connections. Graph stores include Neo4J and Giraph.

Key-value stores are the simplest NoSQL databases. Every single item in the database is stored as an attribute name (or 'key'), together with 
its value. Examples of key-value stores are Riak and Berkeley DB. Some key-value stores, such as Redis, allow each value to have a type, such 
as 'integer', which adds functionality.

Wide-column stores such as Cassandra and HBase are optimized for queries over large datasets, and store columns of data together, instead of rows
