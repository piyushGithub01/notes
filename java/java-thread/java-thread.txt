Thread Dump - bunch of text represent runtine state of program at a particular point time. - snapshot of all the threads that are
alive in jvm - collection of all call stacks of all threads tracked by jvm

Call Stack - stack trace - composed of stack frames

public static void main(String[] args) {
	foo();
}
public void foo() {
	bar();
	buz();
}
public void bar() {}
public void buz() {}

3. bar		once bar is over ->			3. buz
2. foo									2. foo
1. main									1. main

Structure of Thread Dump
1. JVM Threads - some
2. Application Threads - many
3. Heap Report - one

Thread dump structure differs by JVM implementation or platform

Sample Application Thread

"main"	#1	prio=5	os-prio=31	tid=0X0007f8bea802000	nid=0x1c03	waiting on condition 0x00070000d5fa000	
java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)
	at java.lang.Thread.sleep (Native method)
	   org.com....HelloWorld.sleep (HelloWorld.java:15)
	   org.com....HelloWorld.main (HelloWorld.java:10)

1. "main"	name of the thread
2. #1		number of thread
3. prio=5	JVM priority
4. os-prio=31	OS priority
5. tid=0X0007f8bea802000	thread address in memory
6. nid=0x1c03	native id assigned by OS
7. waiting on condition 0x00070000d5fa000		condition
8. java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)			thread state set by JVM
9. at java.lang.Thread.sleep (Native method)				thread call stack
	   org.com....HelloWorld.sleep (HelloWorld.java:15)
	   org.com....HelloWorld.main (HelloWorld.java:10)



	   
Thread state ; 6 defined state in java.lang.Thread.state
Runnable 	   
Waiting

Terminated
	   

Native method: using Java Native INterface JNI calls native method to work with OS resources / file system
		at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketread(Native method)
Low level delegation: java -> java native interface JNI -> c / c++ code

Thread stagnation: Thread stack having very less and slow changes - stuck thread

Starvation of connection pool: 
top command to find high cpu and memory usage
correlate thread native id to os pid and monitor for process and child threads
